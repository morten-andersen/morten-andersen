🤔 Is this just a list of my good deeds? Surely!

But in today’s world, I believe it’s more important than ever to speak openly about what you stand for, be proud of what you support, and let your money follow your values.

### 🗞️ Journalism and Media

Independent, high-quality journalism does not come free. In a world increasingly flooded with misinformation, I believe it’s an obligation to support independent media outlets that uphold truth, integrity, and accountability.

Below is a list of the trusted publications I proudly subscribe to and actively support.

* [**Politiken**](https://politiken.dk/) - traditional social-liberal paper based newspaper, which I have been getting all weekends since the late 90's
* [**Zetland**](https://www.zetland.dk) - independent Danish online media and publishing house focusing on constructive news, background articles and investigative journalism. I have been a subscriber since 2017
* [**The Guardian**](https://www.theguardian.com) - independent newspaper which uncovered the Snowden [NSA surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_global_surveillance_disclosures) scandal in 2013. I have been a subscriber since 2024
  * The Guardian is together with the University of Cambridge behind the innovative tool [CoverDrop](https://www.coverdrop.org/) an open source tool for transparently hiding whistleblower traffic by adding decoy messages inside completely normal news app traffic
* [**Ingeniøren**](https://ing.dk/) - bi-weekly newspaper for Engineers by the Danish Association of Engineers. I have been a subscriber since the late 90's
* [**ACM - Association for Computing Machinery**](https://www.acm.org/) - professional member since 2022 of the world's largest educational and scientific computing society

### 🇩🇰🇪🇺 Political Stance

The world does not become a fairer or better place without action.

Having had the privilege of being born in Scandinavia - where gender equality is high, education is freely accessible, and society is safe enough for individuals to fully realize their potential and enjoy a healthy work-life balance - I feel a strong obligation to support organizations that strive to move the world in the direction I believe in, for those not as fortunate as me

* [**Læger uden Grænser**](https://msf.dk/) - the Danish chapter of *Médecins Sans Frontières* - I deeply believe and support their principles "*.. to contribute to the protection of life and the alleviation of suffering out of respect for human dignity. MSF brings care to people in precarious situations and works towards helping them regain control over their future*". Wherefore I have been a proud supporter every month for more than 20 years since 2003
* [**Dansk Flygtningehjælp**](https://drc.ngo/) - the biggest Danish NGO offering aid to refugees all over the world. I have been supporting them for more than 10 years since 2015. After the Russian invasion in Ukraine in 2022 I significantly increased my monthly support
* [**RMI - Rocky Mountain Institute**](https://rmi.org) - a nonprofit that publishes trustworthy information on the green‑energy transition, serving as a balancing voice to the oil‑industry‑funded think‑tanks. I have supported the organization since 2024
  * I keep a small personal collection of notes on the green-energy transition 🌍 [here](https://book-notes.accel.dk/green-energy/)
* [**The Libel Reform Campaign**](https://senseaboutscience.org/activities/libel-reform/) - a campaign back in 2010 to reform the libel and deformation laws in Great Britain which threatened scientific debate
* [**Foreningen imod Ulovlig Logning**](https://ulovliglogning.dk/) - a campaign in 2022 to end the mass retention of telecom data in Denmark without any legal foundation. This has on several occasions been deemed clearly illegal by the European Court of Justice
