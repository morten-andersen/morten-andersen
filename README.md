### THE WHY? - why am I a software developer

* First and foremost to solve real world customer problems
* Because I like analyzing problems and like to design and implement solutions that solves problems
* Because of the creative process of solving problems - it is full of math, it is full of logic
* Because of the beautiful algorithms
* Because software is 100% freedom in building things
* Because software is not limited by physical boundaries
* Because in software it is possible to build huge distributed systems, spanning several machines and physical locations
* Because It is like LEGO with all the bricks in the world
* Because I care for details - software is about the little details, the well thought architecture, the solid implementation
